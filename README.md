# Machine Learning KC

The repository contains the following files to solve 2 problems with the library of Machine Learning of Python scikit-learn.

The files are:
  1. data/
  2. Enunciado_Practica_ML_101.pdf
  3. Machine_Learning_KC.ipynb
  4. README.md
 
## 1. data/

This file contains all the data to draw all the graphs and dashboard of the practice.

The data files are:
  1. census.csv: You need this data base to solve the first part of the problem
  2. diamonds.csv: You need this data base to solve the second part of the problem 
 

## 2. Enunciado Practica ML 101.pdf

This file explains the practice. This practice has two parts:

 I. Lineal Regression Problem. In this part is explained every variable of the problem is explained. We are using the data base census.csv
 
 II. Classification Problem. In this part is explained every variable of the problem is explained. We are using the data base diamonds.csv

## 3. Machine_Learning_KC.ipynb

This file contains the study of 2 problems that are solved with the aid of the Python library Scikit-Learn. 

In the first part of the practice we solve a Lineal Regression problem and we use census data base.

In the second part of the practice we solve a Classification problem and we use diamonds data base.
